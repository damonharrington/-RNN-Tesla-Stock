Building an RNN model for Tesla's Stock Prediction
Tesla Stock Price Prediction Using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
# Description:
This repository demonstrates the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for predicting Tesla stock prices based on historical data. The project showcases how deep learning can be applied to time-series data to forecast stock trends, aiding in decision-making for investors and analysts.

# Features:
Data Preprocessing: Includes steps for cleaning, normalizing, and preparing the time-series data for analysis.
Feature Engineering: Utilizes sliding windows and other techniques to create sequential input data for the RNN.
Model Implementation: Builds an RNN model (e.g., LSTM or GRU) tailored for time-series forecasting.
Evaluation Metrics: Analyzes performance using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE).
Visualization: Provides graphical representations of predictions vs. actual prices to assess model performance.
